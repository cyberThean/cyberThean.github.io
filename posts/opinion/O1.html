<p>As a first post I think it's fair to explain who am I and why I do this blog.</p>

<p>I'm a tech lover since I was a kid, and I still am. I'm constantly curious about computer science, but also interested in how internet and technology has changed everyone's life around the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But, as good as internet is, the consequent accomodations overcame the one's privacy. Usually the easiest way is the most exposed, where our location, name and in general, our information is almost a public domain. All of us have tried typing our name on google, or looking for someone we knew. The fact we are easily connected to anyone is both amazing and disturbing. I used to thought either way our information is being stored so there's no point on fighting against it, not like a single person can hide and act. But eventually I became more and more aware, that my life is my life and I like to be behind the curtain and not exposed. Not because I would do anything illegal, it's just a matter of privacy, like you would hide your nude body and close the door, I wan't to keep away from sights. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And I thought, this should be a thing, this should be something to ask for. An then I realised there were a lot of people who were desiring the same and even fighting for it. I don't find myself fighting for it, but surely asking for it, more like a watcher than an activist. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyway I created this blog in order to find this private spot, in order to write my thoughts anonymously. I hope there are many like me out there, willing to speak behind a mask.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have a good day, and be careful out there. </p>
<p></p>
